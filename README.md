# Portfolio

This work portfolio contains the following projects:

**DC Car Crashes Shiny App:** This folder contains three scripts related to a shiny web app I created allowing a user to explore motor vehicle crashes involving cyclists and pedestrians.
1. clean_data.R cleans raw data from the DC Open Data "Crashes in DC" dataset: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::crashes-in-dc/about
2. app.R creates the shiny app
3. run_and_deploy.R is a short script that deploys the app to shinyapps.io
4. The app can be accessed here: https://kbisson18.shinyapps.io/dc_car_crashes/

**KD Tree Class:** This program creates a KD tree class with user methods for KNN and circular range querying.

**Writing Sample - Leasing Working Paper:** This document contains an excerpt from the working paper on natural gas leasing I worked on as an undergraduate research assistant.
